Revision history for Array-Columnize

0.3.8 - 
    - Made the Build.PL non-executable (for better kwalitee:
        - http://cpants.perl.org/kwalitee.html#buildtool_not_executable
    - Add an environment variable - PERL_MB_NOSIGN to disable signing a package
    (which interferes with the flow of doing ./Build disttest ).
    - Renamed Makefile to Makefile.devel so doing perl Makefile.PL won't 
    interfere with it.
    - Correct some typos in the README.md and added a TODO there (SHLOMIF).
    - Add some POD to lib/Array/Columnize.pm (SHLOMIF).

0.3.7 - Oct 28, 2011
I said, no feature "say"!

0.3.6 - Oct 27, 2011
Remove feature "say" so it works on Perl pre 5.010.

0.3.5 - Sept 05, 2011
