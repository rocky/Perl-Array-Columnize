Revision history for Array-Columnize

    - Made the Build.PL non-executable (for better kwalitee:
        - http://cpants.perl.org/kwalitee.html#buildtool_not_executable
    - Add an environment variable - PERL_MB_NOSIGN to disable signing a package
    (which interferes with the flow of doing ./Build disttest ).
    - Renamed Makefile to Makefile.devel so doing perl Makefile.PL won't 
    interfere with it.
    - Correct some typos in the README.md and added a TODO there (SHLOMIF).
    - Add some POD to lib/Array/Columnize.pm (SHLOMIF).
        - Rocky should fill the leftovers.
